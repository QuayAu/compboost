## compboost: Fast and Flexible Component-Wise Boosting Framework

Component-wise boosting applies the boosting framework to
statistical models, e.g., general additive models using component-wise smoothing 
splines. Boosting these kinds of models maintains interpretability and enables 
unbiased model selection in high dimensional feature spaces. 

The `R` package `compboost` is an alternative implementation of component-wise
boosting written in `C++` to obtain high runtime
performance and full memory control. The main idea is to provide a modular
class system which can be extended without editing the
source code. Therefore, it is possible to use `R` functions as well as
`C++` functions for custom base-learners, losses, logging mechanisms or 
stopping criteria.

For an introduction and overview about the functionality visit the [project page](https://schalkdaniel.github.io/compboost/).

## Installation

#### Developer version:

```r
devtools::install_github("schalkdaniel/compboost")
```

## Examples

This examples are rendered using <code>compboost `r packageVersion("compboost")`</code>.

To be as flexible as possible one should use the `R6` API do define base-learner, losses, stopping criteria, or optimizer as desired. Another option is to use wrapper functions as described on the [project page](https://schalkdaniel.github.io/compboost/).

```{r cboost, fig.show="hide", out.width="70%"}
library(compboost)

# Check installed version:
packageVersion("compboost")

# Load data set with binary classification task:
data(PimaIndiansDiabetes, package = "mlbench")
# Create categorical feature:
PimaIndiansDiabetes$pregnant.cat = ifelse(PimaIndiansDiabetes$pregnant == 0, "no", "yes")

# Define Compboost object:
cboost = Compboost$new(data = PimaIndiansDiabetes, target = "diabetes", loss = QuadraticLoss$new())
cboost

# Add p-spline base-learner with default parameter:
cboost$addBaselearner(feature = "pressure", id = "spline", bl.factory = PSplineBlearner)

# Add another p-spline learner with custom parameters:
cboost$addBaselearner(feature = "age", id = "spline", bl.factory = PSplineBlearner, degree = 3, 
  knots = 10, penalty = 4, differences = 2)

# Add categorical feature (as single linear base-learner):
cboost$addBaselearner(feature = "pregnant.cat", id = "category", bl.factory = PolynomialBlearner,
	degree = 1, intercept = FALSE)

# Check all registered base-learner:
cboost$getBaselearnerNames()

# Train model:
cboost$train(1000L, trace = FALSE)
cboost

cboost$getBaselearnerNames()

selected.features = cboost$selected()
table(selected.features)

params = cboost$coef()
str(params)

cboost$train(3000)

cboost$plot("age_spline", iters = c(100, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000)) +
  ggthemes::theme_tufte() + 
  ggplot2::scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral")
