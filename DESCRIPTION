Description: A C++ implementation of componentwise boosting. The idea is to 
    patch all components, which are implemented as class, together. This 
    gives the user maximal flexiblity. In addition the main classes can be 
    extended with custom functions from R. This will slow down the whole 
    algorithm. Nevertheless, it is possible to do some prototyping within R for 
    custom baselearner.
