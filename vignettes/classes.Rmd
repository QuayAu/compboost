\section{The Classes of Compboost}

As often pointed out, `compboost` includes many different classes. In this 
section we want to give a overview about these classes and their functionality.
This section first describes the classes that are independent of other classes
like the loss class and then goes on to classes which includes other ones
like the baselearner factory list class which obviously includes baselearner 
factories. \\

To be as flexible as possible, it is important that different classes of the 
same type (e.~g.~Bernoulli loss and quadratic loss, both losses) can be 
called identically. This is required since we are trying to be as generic as 
possible which results that many classes are child classes of abstract parent
classes. Using this polymorphism ensures consistent function calls and pretend 
a minimal functionlaity of all child classes. This section is also intended to 
clarify where and how such relationships exists. \\

For a more detailed documentation which also illustrated the dependencies and
between the classes see the `C++` documentation:

\subsection{Loss Classes}

For a theoretical background see section methodology.

\subsubsection{\texttt{Loss} (Abstract/Parent)}

This class defines functions that each child class must have. The child classes
contains the concrete implementation. The following functions are defined as
virtual, hence these have to be defined within the child classes which derive
that virtual functions:

- `arma::vec definedLoss (const arma::vec&, const arma::vec&)`
- `arma::vec definedGradient (const arma::vec&, const arma::vec&)`
- `double 	constantInitializer (const arma::vec&)`
