\section{The Classes of Compboost}

As often pointed out, `compboost` includes many different classes. In this 
section we want to give a overview about these classes and their functionality.
This section first describes the classes that are independent of other classes
like the loss class and then goes on to classes which includes other ones
like the baselearner factory list class which obviously includes baselearner 
factories. \\

To be as flexible as possible, it is important that different classes of the 
same type (e.~g.~Bernoulli loss and quadratic loss, both losses) can be 
called identically. This is required since we are trying to be as generic as 
possible which results that many classes are child classes of abstract parent
classes. Using this polymorphism ensures consistent function calls and pretend 
a minimal functionlaity of all child classes. This section is also intended to 
clarify where and how such relationships exists.

\subsection{Loss Classes}

As one of the key features of compboost we firstly introduce the loss classes.
This classes 

\subsubsection{\texttt{Loss} (Abstract/Parent)}

\subsubsection{\texttt{QuadraticLoss} (Child)}

\subsubsection{\texttt{AbsoluteLoss} (Child)}

\subsubsection{\texttt{BernoulliLoss} (Child)}

\subsubsection{\texttt{CustomLoss} (Child)}


\subsection{\texttt{Data} (Abstract/Parent)}

\subsubsection{\texttt{InMemoryData} (Child)}
