\subsection{Detailed Description}
Logger class to log the current iteration. 

This class seems to be useless, but it gives more control about the algorithm and doesn\textquotesingle{}t violate the idea of object programming here. Additionally, it is quite convenient to have this class instead of tracking the iteration at any stage of the fitting within the compboost object as another vector. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
C\+:/\+Users/schal/\+One\+Drive/github\+\_\+repos/compboost/src/\mbox{\hyperlink{logger_8h}{logger.\+h}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
