compboost: Fast and Flexible Component-Wise Boosting Framework
--------------------------------------------------------------

Component-wise boosting applies the boosting framework to statistical models, e.g., general additive models using component-wise smoothing splines. Boosting these kinds of models maintains interpretability and enables unbiased model selection in high dimensional feature spaces.

The `R` package `compboost` is an alternative implementation of component-wise boosting written in `C++` to obtain high runtime performance and full memory control. The main idea is to provide a modular class system which can be extended without editing the source code. Therefore, it is possible to use `R` functions as well as `C++` functions for custom base-learners, losses, logging mechanisms or stopping criteria.

For an introduction and overview about the functionality visit the [project page](https://schalkdaniel.github.io/compboost/).

Installation
------------

#### Developer version:

``` r
devtools::install_github("schalkdaniel/compboost")
```

Examples
--------

This examples are rendered using <code>compboost 0.1.0</code>.

To be as flexible as possible one should use the `R6` API do define base-learner, losses, stopping criteria, or optimizer as desired. Another option is to use wrapper functions as described on the [project page](https://schalkdaniel.github.io/compboost/).

``` r
library(compboost)

# Check installed version:

## [1] '0.1.0'

# Load data set with binary classification task:
data(PimaIndiansDiabetes, package = "mlbench")
# Create categorical feature:
PimaIndiansDiabetes$pregnant.cat = ifelse(PimaIndiansDiabetes$pregnant == 0, "no", "yes")

# Define Compboost object:
cboost = Compboost$new(data = PimaIndiansDiabetes, target = "diabetes", loss = QuadraticLoss$new())

# Add p-spline base-learner with default parameter:

# Add another p-spline learner with custom parameters:

  knots = 10, penalty = 4, differences = 2)
## Warning in .handleRcpp_PSplineBlearner(degree = 3, knots = 10, penalty =

# Add categorical feature (as single linear base-learner):
